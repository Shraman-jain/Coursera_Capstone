    "The Seattle government is going to prevent avoidable car accidents by employing methods that alert drivers, health system, and police to remind them to be more careful in critical situations. In most cases, not paying enough attention during driving, abusing drugs and alcohol or driving at very high speed are the main causes of occurring accidents that can be prevented by enacting harsher regulations.\n",

    "Besides the aforementioned reasons, weather, visibility, or road conditions are the major uncontrollable factors that can be prevented by revealing hidden patterns in the data and announcing warning to the local government, police and drivers on the targeted roads.\n",

    "The target audience of the project is local Seattle government, police, rescue groups, and last but not least, car insurance institutes. The model and its results are going to provide some advice for the target audience to make insightful decisions for reducing the number of accidents and injuries for the city."

    "We chose the unbalanced dataset provided by the Seattle Department of Transportation Traffic Management Division with 194673 rows (accidents) and 37 columns (features) where each accident is given a severity code. It covers accidents from January 2004 to May 2020. Some of the features in this dataset include and are not limited to Severity code, Location/Address of accident, Weather condition at the incident site, Driver state (whether under influence or not), collision type. Hence we think its a good generalized dataset which will help us in creating an accurate predictive model. The unbalance with respect to the severity code in the dataset is as follows.\n",
